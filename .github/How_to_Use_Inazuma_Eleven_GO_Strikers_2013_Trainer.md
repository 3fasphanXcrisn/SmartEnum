If you want to enhance your gameplay experience, you can use a trainer program that allows you to modify various aspects of the game, such as your characters' stats, TP, Kakusei level, and hissatsu techniques. A trainer is a helpful "hack" that can make the game easier or more fun.
 
However, using a trainer requires some caution and knowledge, as it can also cause the game to crash or malfunction if used incorrectly. In this article, we will show you how to use Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 trainer safely and effectively.

8. Change the hissatsu ID to any value that you want. You can refer to the list of hissatsu IDs that came with the trainer program. For example, if you want to change Fire Tornado to Death Drop, you can change the ID from 0A to 0B.
9. Click on Write button to apply the changes. You should see a message saying "Write successful".
10. Go back to the game and check if the hissatsu has changed. If not, try restarting the game or reloading your save file.

## Tips and Warnings

- You can use the trainer to modify other aspects of the game, such as your characters' stats, TP, Kakusei level, match time, and TP refill speed. Just change the values in the trainer and click on Write button.
- You can also use the trainer to perform any hissatsu technique regardless of your character's body type. For example, you can make Kabeyama use Fire Tornado or Gouenji use Buttobi Jump. However, this may cause some graphical glitches or crashes, so use it at your own risk.
- You can only use one hissatsu technique per section. For example, you cannot have two shooting techniques or two dribbling techniques for one character. If you try to do so, the game may crash or malfunction.
- You should always backup your 0f148eb4a0
